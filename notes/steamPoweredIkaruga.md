SHOOTING GAME;

## JET FIGHTER SIMULATION NOTES

1) reminder: cascading deaths first caused by lone, small and slow ENERGY BULLET

2) caution: with hitting self after destroying enemy; STARWARS?<br/>
--> due: to ENERGY BULLETS as OUTPUT from destroyed object may HIT self;

3) notes: death caused by overlapping ENERGY BULLETS of same polarity;

4) caution: when attempting to destroy everything;<br/>
--> due: to ENERGY BULLETS as OUTPUT from destroyed object may HIT self;

5) notes: self is destroyed after hitting ENEMY even if with SAME POLARITY;

6) notes: OUTPUT ENERGY BULLETS from destroyed ENEMY are of the SAME POLARITY as that used to destroy it;
--> IF ENERGY BULLET used to destroy ENEMY is of opposite POLARITY of the destroyed ENEMY,<br/> 
--> there shall be no OUTPUT ENERGY BULLETS

7) notes: HOMING ENERGY BULLETS auto-targets based on nearest distance to self;<br/>
--> adds: RISK & RETURN exists due to noticeable count of destroyed ENEMIES<br/> 
--> via only one (1) BUTTON COMMAND;<br/>
--> notes: RISK to be OUTPUT ENERGY BULLETS from ALL destroyed ENEMIES

8) notes: technique of listening to RADIO using MACHINE#2 with one (1) earphone (with mic),<br/>
--> while as PILOT in JET FIGHTER of MACHINE#1 also with one (1) earphone, executing STEAMPOWERED; <br/>
--> Churchill, W.'s [The Gathering Storm](https://www.amazon.com/Gathering-Storm-Second-World-War/dp/039541055X)?<br/>
--> RADIO: [YES933 Singapore](https://www.melisten.sg/radio/yes-933)<br/>
--> RADIO: [TOKYO FM: School of Lock](https://www.tfm.co.jp/lock/index.html); 

9) observed: listening/viewing another MONITOR (YOUTUBE) via MACHINE#2<br/> 
--> causes ERRORS for fast ACTION JET FIGHTER SIMULATION in MACHINE#1; <br/>
--> adds: AD/CM appears; example: GRAMMARLY in [JWONG in JAPAN: USF4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqPpUEPWF_M);<br/>
--> notes: RADIO (audio only) appears more EFFECTIVE

10) notes: SYSTEM SETTINGS exist to cause change, e.g. SOUND level;<br/>
--> observed: in Windows laptop machine, earphone can be incorrectly inserted into mic input slot;

11) notes: HOMING ENERGY BULLETS may destroy enemies behind JET FIGHTER,<br/>
--> where: OUTPUT ENERGY BULLETS from destroyed enemies may HIT self;

12) notes: TRIGGER#2 @RIGHT-SHOULDER BUTTON of XBOX360 controller <br/>
--> appears: as that used in PROJECTILE WEAPON, e.g. GUN TRIGGER, <br/>
--> via: usual holding of the XBOX360 controller with hands,<br/>
--> where: XBOX button of controller is a square @x and z-axes <br/>
--> of the default coordinate system;
